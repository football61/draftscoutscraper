# draftscoutscraper

This script downloads NFL prospect rankings from the website www.draftscout.com.  It scrapes each team's prospects by year into csv files.  From there, I conver the rankings into percentiles.

When paired with a depth chart, the percentiles are useful in comparing the talent levels of teams.
When paired with 247sports recruiting data, you can rank each College's ability to develop players.  You can also find what states have overrated and underrated players.  For example, as of my last scrape, florida high schools produced 0 NFL draft prospects at the QB position.
